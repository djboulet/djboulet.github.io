Return Loss Calculator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Return Loss Calculator performs the same calculations as the True VSWR calculator but presents the results differently.  The Return Loss Calculator allows for direct conversion of VSWR to Return Loss and vice versa.  Two cable types are alos offered on the right-hand portion of the nomograph.  The frequency is choosen by amateur band.  Missing from this nomograph is the ability to calcuate VSWR from forward and reflected power readings.
