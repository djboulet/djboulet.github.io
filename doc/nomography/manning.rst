Manning Formula
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Manning formula or Manning's equation is 
an empirical formula estimating the average velocity of a 
liquid flowing in a conduit that does not completely enclose the 
liquid, i.e., open channel flow. However, this equation 
is also used for calculation of flow variables in case of flow in 
partially full conduits, as they also possess a free surface like that of 
open channel flow. All flow in so-called open channels is driven by gravity. :cite:`manning`
