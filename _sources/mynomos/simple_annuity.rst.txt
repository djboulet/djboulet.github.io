Simple Annuity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following nomograph is related to the `amortized loan calculator example in the PyNomo documentation <http://lefakkomies.github.io/pynomo-doc/examples/examples.html#example-amortized-loan-calculator>`_.  However, rather than calculate outflow of cash of a loan, the nomograph below calculates inflow of cash of a fixed annuity.
