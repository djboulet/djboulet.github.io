Simple Annuity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following nomograph is related to the `amortized loan calculator example in the PyNomo 
documentation <http://lefakkomies.github.io/pynomo-doc/examples/examples.html#example-amortized-loan-calculator>`_.  
However this example calculates income from an annuity rather than the expense of a loan or mortgage.
