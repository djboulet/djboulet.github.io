Air Coil Design
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Air coil design nomographs come in a range of shapes, sizes and methods of use.  In this example, PyNomo is 
used to reconstruct part of the single-layer air coil calculator nomograph 
published in `Electronics World (1962) <https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Electronics-World/60s/1962/Electronics-World-1962-08.pdf>`_.
