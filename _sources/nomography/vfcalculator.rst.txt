Velocity Factor Calculator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:math:`\frac{1}{4}\lambda` matching stubs can be created with different types of coax cable.  
However the velocity factor of coax cables varies by type and manufacturer.  
This nomograph allows an engineer to substitute one type of cable for another of different length and velocity factor.
