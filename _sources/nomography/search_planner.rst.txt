Search Planner
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Grid searches when conducted by ground search and rescue personnel are slow and labour intensive tasks.
Search planners will want to allocate scarce resources (searchers and time) appropriately.
Knowing the length of time required to search a parcel of land can help assign resources effeciently.
